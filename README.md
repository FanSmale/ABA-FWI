# ABA-FWI
ABA-FWI is an algorithm of augmented Boundary Attention for Full Waveform Inversion.  The spatial attention module (SAM) is incorporated into every stage of resolution enhancement in the decoder.  In addition, the reflection coefficient tuned boundary loss (RCTB loss) is designed to supplement the penalty for boundary misfit.
